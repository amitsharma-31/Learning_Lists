Set up SSH SOCKS Tunnel for Private Browsing
Set up ssh tunnel to server - This server can act as tunnel server which will give access to whole network

Generally, we have jump host for environment and within that environment many things gets accessed example ILO's/DRACs any webui over 80 or 8080.
Those things can be accessed using this below tunnel mechanism.

Tunnel port (port 9090 in our below example) will be used and execute remote call/connection with that target IP and port

# ssh -N -D 9090 [USER]@[SERVER_IP]
  -N - Tells SSH not to execute a remote command.
  -D 9090 - Opens a SOCKS tunnel on the specified port number.
  [USER]@[SERVER_IP] - Your remote SSH user and server IP address.
  To run the command in the background use the -f option.

If using putty instead of ssh client
  Under the Connection menu, expand SSH and select Tunnels. Enter the port 9090 in the Source Port field, and check the Dynamic radio button.
  Click on the Add button as shown in the image below.
